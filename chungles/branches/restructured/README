What is Chungles?

Simply: It's a file-sharing program for local networks that runs on any platform.

More, it's a file-sharing program that utilizes ZeroConf (JmDNS libraries) for computer detection and shares files easily about platforms with simple drag n'drop. The GUI is done in SWT (allowing native graphics) and the program is written in Java.

To install:

 *Get SWT libraries for your system from http://www.eclipse.org/swt/ and extract them inside this directory
 *Make sure you have ant
 *Run 'ant' to compile

To run:

 *Run 'ant run' (or in windows there's a batch file - chungles.bat)
